Please don't move the .gitignore file from under TurboRepo

The Dockerfile build step executes with the TurboRepo folder as its working directory, 
and consequently cant access any files in parent folders on the host filesystem.

The Dockerfile has to have the same parent folder as the execution of the npm apps,
because Aspire only has one local directory concept per resource, and for correct local
execution of the turbo apps the working directory needs to be the TurboRepo folder.

So we do need a .gitignore file inside the TurboRepo folder where it can be accessed
by the Dockerfiles.
